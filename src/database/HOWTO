Necessary packages
----------------------

There are a few packages that need to be installed to get the database running
These are the Ubuntu/Debian packages

* ~$ sudo apt-get install python-sqlalchemy
* ~$ sudo apt-get install python-psycopg2

Optionally, to produce a schema display of the database install:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sqlalchemy_schemadisplay/


To populate the database
-------------------------------

(1) Create an empty Postgresql database
(2) Tell htsint your database params
    * ~$ mv config.py.dist config.py
    * Then edit the file with the appropriate info
    * the field 'dbhost' may be 'localhost' or a remote one
    * edit the taxa field depending on user needs

(3) ~$ python FetchNcbiData.py
(4) ~$ python CreateDatabase.py
(5) ~$ python TestDatabase.py

'FetchNcbieData.py' - may take a few hours to download.  
Do not get rid of the downloaded files, because when the script is run again
it will keep the up-to-date files and renew only the outdated ones.  

'CreateDatabase.py' - will take some time to run and perhaps it 
should be planned for overnight.

'TestDatabase.py' - will it will just run simple queries.  Also,
if sqlalchemy_schemadisplay is installed then a plot will be created.

Appending to the database
-------------------------------

The following scirpt may be used:

    python DatabaseAppend.py -t 8355,8364

Otherwise, append to the config.py file and repopulate the entire database.
