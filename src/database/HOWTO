Necessary packages
----------------------

There are a few packages that need to be installed to get the database running
These are the Ubuntu/Debian packages

* ~$ sudo apt-get install python-sqlalchemy
* ~$ sudo apt-get install python-psycopg2

Optionally, to produce a schema display of the database install:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sqlalchemy_schemadisplay/

NOTE: if the server is not started or was stopped

  ~$ sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start


To populate the database
-------------------------------

(1) Create an empty Postgresql database
(2) Tell htsint your database params
    * ~$ mv config.py.dist config.py
    * Then edit the file with the appropriate info
    * the field 'dbhost' may be 'localhost' or a remote one
    * edit the taxa field depending on user needs

(3) ~$ python FetchNcbiData.py
(4) ~$ python CreateDatabase.py
(5) ~$ python TestDatabase.py

'FetchNcbieData.py' - may take a few hours to download.  
Do not get rid of the downloaded files, because when the script is run again
it will keep the up-to-date files and renew only the outdated ones.  

'CreateDatabase.py' - will take some time to run and perhaps it 
should be planned for overnight.

'TestDatabase.py' - will it will just run simple queries.  Also,
if sqlalchemy_schemadisplay is installed then a plot will be created.

Appending to the database
-------------------------------

The following scirpt may be used:

    python DatabaseAppend.py -t 8355,8364

Otherwise, append to the config.py file and repopulate the entire database.


Adding Gene Ontology information from the GO
-----------------------------------------------

By default the gene2go.db file is used.  However if the following steps are run
all GO information contained therein will removed and replaced with information 
from the GO.


Go into your config.py file and add the species specific annotations.  For example,
This is done by getting the exact name of the file from:

http://www.geneontology.org/GO.downloads.annotations.shtml


(1) download the ontology file  

  go_daily-termdb.obo-xml
