The database is built around the following file.
   
    gene_association.goa_uniprot

This file contains all GO annotations and protein information for
proteins in the UniProt KnowledgeBase (UniProtKB). If a particular
protein accession is not annotated with GO, then it will not appear in
this file. The file is provided as GAF2.0 format.

    http://www.geneontology.org/GO.format.gaf-2_0.shtml

There are 17 tab delimited fields.  Many databases are used to
populate the goa file and the abbreviations can be found at

    http://www.geneontology.org/cgi-bin/xrefs.cgi

  * Column 2 is the unique identifier
  * Column 3 contains a UniGene entry

UniProt creates a RefSeq protein centric mapping

If a UniProtKB protein does not map to a RefSeq Protein, this entry
will not have a GeneID cross-reference.

We map UniGene entries to a NCBI GeneID with

    ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/gene2unigene

Multiple unigene identifiers may map to a single GeneID
